**MULU INTRO PROJECT**

This project is designed to evaluate my skills building a full-stack application. It is a simplified version of the Mulu MVP,
and ideally, it can be extended to the full product if I'm hired.

My focus should be on building a working application. The application does not need to have many features, nor does it need to be polished. Instead, focus on writing simple, high-quality code and deploying a working version.

## Dependencies

- NodeJS - A JavaScript runtime environment
- Express - A web application framework for NodeJS
